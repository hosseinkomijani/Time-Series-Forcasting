International Airline Passengers prediction problem.
The task is to predict the number of international airline passengers in units of 1,000. 
The data ranges from January 1949 to December 1960, or 12 years, with 144 observations.

I utilized Arima model and Neural networks (Dense, LSTM, RNN, Bidirectional-LSTM, ConvLSTM2D) for time series forcasting for this problem.
